# choco-os
A beta OS called Chocolate. Delicious!

WHAT IT IS:
This IS NOT an actual OS you can flash. Does that mean you can't flash it? Of course not!
This IS an app that simulates an Operating System.

HOW TO USE IT:
Example uses include
- Recording and Audio
- Making Games (it will have its own Game engine soon)
- Possible HARDWARE support!!!

LIMITATIONS:
84 MB of actual storage. The software will say something from 90 to 180 MB, we're testing out an encryption addon we made.
- So far, there's an 18% decrease in file size if you just use the unicode from the system from the unicode originally in the software.
- So far, there's a 49.1% decrease in file size THEORETICALLY if you download the encrypted file, which is a .XCHOCOLATE file that can only be decoded via our DECRYPTOR for CHOCOLATE OS, which can be found in our special decoder, free, at our app link on itch.io, [here](https://erabienda.itch.io/hotchocolate).

# Error Codes
Error Code #000000
- "You have failed Choco, and the rest of our community. Either uninstall or forever live with your guilt. We know what/that you cannot see in the dark."
- Meaning: You told the app you cannot accept the MIT License, so it boots you off. You go back on for it to shame you for not accepting the terms of service.
- Action you committed: Denying the Terms of Use.
- Other possible actions: Nothing.
- Action to commit to fix: Uninstall the app and then re-install it. If that does not work, there's nothing you can do. It's hardcoded to not do anything as soon as you go into the app, except for back itself out.

Error Code #0X0X0X
- "There is nothing you can do now... Nothing besides pray and hope for the better."
- Meaning: Your IP got banned.
- Action you committed: Online Hacking.
- Other possible actions: Nothing.
- Action to commit to fix: Nothing.

There are of course other Error codes which will be here soon, not in the "README" file but in a separate file.
